# RobloxCrossServerPlayers

Get around Roblox's pesky player limits with this janky, but functional solution!

## About

RobloxCrossServerPlayers is a quirky project aimed at bypassing Roblox's player limit by juggling players across servers. It's not pretty, but it gets the job done.

## Setup

1. **Fire up the Jank:**
   - Just run `index.js` and cross your fingers. No guarantees here!
   - Make sure your port forwarding if your using your home newtork.
   - I reccomend to use a server instead of your home pc.

2. **Edit the Script:**
   - Open the Roblox game in Studio.
   - Find the script in `ServerScriptService`.
   - Stick your IP in there. Good luck!

3. **Max Server Size: 1:**
   - Go to the Roblox website, configure your place, and set the max server size to 1. This is where the magic happens... hopefully.

4. **Play With Friends:**
   - Now, pray it works and invite your pals. Let's see how many can fit before it all falls apart!

## Features (or Lack Thereof)

- **Cross Server... Something:** Yeah, there's some kind of chat thing that might work across servers. No promises.
- **Low Latency... LOL:** Expect a bit of lag, glitches, and possibly tears. But hey, it's an adventure!
